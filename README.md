## Description

Clocker is a console application for keeping track of your working time. The working time is stored in a local file-based database (JSON). With simple commands, you're able to start and stop the time tracking for the current day or generate/modify existing records.

As shown in the image, Clocker does support different day types (**W**: workday, **V**: vacation, **H**: public holidays, **S**: sick). The public holidays can be automatically added with `holidays` command and will be displayed in cyan.

With the configuration file `settings.ini` it is possible to specify default values like working hours per day, default pause time, or certain behavioral features like the rounding to quarter hours while tracking the time.

## Features

- Easy to use and automate
- Overview of your vacation, flex and sick days
- Automatically add public holidays
- Compact and clear monthly view
- Configurable default values and behaviors
- PDF report generation

## Limitations

- Display is specified in german date & time format
- Public holidays are taken from Germany, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg

## Automate tracking on Windows

The idea behind the automation is to run the `start` command whenever you start working (startup/logon) and the `stop` command when you stop working (shutdown, logoff). With that setup `Clocker` will automatically track your working hours without the need of taking any action.

### Create custom console command

Create a file with the following name: `clocker.cmd` and content:

```batch
python -m clocker %*
```

In order to let the console recognize the custom command, the path to file must be added to the path environment variable of Windows.

### Run commands based on Windows Events

There're multiple ways to run scripts based on certain Windows Events. Two commonly used ones are:

- [Task Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler): launches scripts at pre-defined times or after specified time intervals
- [Group Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn789196(v=ws.11)#:~:text=computer%20shutdown%20scripts-,To%20assign%20computer%20shutdown%20scripts,Scripts%20(Startup%2FShutdown).): add startup, shutdown, logon, and logoff scripts
